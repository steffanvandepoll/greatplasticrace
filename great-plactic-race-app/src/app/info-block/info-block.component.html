            You’ll probably be surprised to know that plastics make up more than 12% of all solid waste disposed. <em>This is equivalent to 30 million tons of plastic being disposed every year! </em>

            Do you have an idea of how long it takes for plastics to degrade back into the environment? The answer may surprise you. It’s between 500-1000 years. This is well beyond comprehension for most people.

            As a matter of fact, 90% of all waste that is floating on the surface of oceans is plastic. That can be approximated to about 46,000 pieces of plastic per square mile!

                  Another reason why plastic recycling is important is because it can put to good use rather than unnecessarily ending up in landfall. Recycled plastic can be used to create items such as shampoo bottles, oil funnels, floor tiles and traffic cones among many other products.
